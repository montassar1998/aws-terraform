  region     = "us-east-1"
  access_key = "*****"
  secret_key = "*********"


  either add these values inside main.tf : provider "aws" {} block 
  or
  install aws cli with terraform's shared_credentials_file settings using shared_credentials_file = "/home/vagrant/.aws/credentials" like this
  
  
  provider "aws" {
   profile    = "test"
   region     = "eu-central-1"
   shared_credentials_file = "/home/vagrant/.aws/credentials"
}

    or configure aws credentaisl as env vars AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    After exporting the above variables you do not need to hard code or refer to /.aws/credentials file.

    You can simply write you are terraforming configuration and terraform will fetch the AWS Credentials from the environment variables
